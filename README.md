</p>

This action sets up a java environment for use in actions by:

- optionally downloading and caching a requested version of java by version and adding to PATH. Default downloads are populated from the [Zulu Community distribution of OpenJDK](http://static.azul.com/zulu/bin/)
- registering problem matchers for error output

# Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)

## Basic
```yaml
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
- uses: actions/setup-java@v1
  with:
    java-version: '9.0.4' # The JDK version to make available on the path.
    java-package: jdk # (jre, jdk, or jdk+fx) - defaults to jdk
    architecture: x64 # (x64 or x86) - defaults to x64
- run: java -cp java HelloWorldApp
```
Examples of version specifications that the java-version parameter will accept:

- A major Java version

  e.g. ```6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, ...```

- A semver Java version specification

  e.g. ```8.0.232, 7.0.181, 11.0.4```

  e.g. ```8.0.x, >11.0.3, >=13.0.1, <8.0.212```

- An early access (EA) Java version

  e.g. ```14-ea, 15-ea```

  e.g. ```14.0.0-ea, 15.0.0-ea```

  e.g. ```14.0.0-ea.28, 15.0.0-ea.2``` (syntax for specifying an EA build number)

  Note that, per semver rules, EA builds will be matched by explicit EA version specifications.

- 1.x syntax

    e.g. ```1.8``` (same as ```8```)

    e.g. ```1.8.0.212``` (same as ```8.0.212```)


## Local file
```yaml
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
- uses: actions/setup-java@v1
  with:
    java-version: '4.0.0'
    architecture: x64
    jdkFile: <path to jdkFile> # Optional - jdkFile to install java from. Useful for versions not found on Zulu Community CDN
- run: java -cp java HelloWorldApp
```

## Matrix Testing
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-16.04
    strategy:
      matrix:
        # test against latest update of each major Java version, as well as specific updates of LTS versions:
        java: [ 1.6, 6.0.83, 7, 7.0.181, 8, 8.0.192, 9.0.x, 10, 11.0.x, 11.0.3, 12, 13 ]
    name: Java ${{ matrix.java }} sample
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup java
        uses: actions/setup-java@v1
        with:
          java-version: ${{ matrix.java }}
      - run: java -cp java HelloWorldApp
```

## Publishing using Apache Maven
```yaml
jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up JDK 1.8
      uses: actions/setup-java@v1
      with:
        java-version: 1.8

    - name: Build with Maven
      run: mvn -B package --file pom.xml

    - name: Publish to GitHub Packages Apache Maven
      run: mvn deploy
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }} # GITHUB_TOKEN is the default env for the password

    - name: Set up Apache Maven Central
      uses: actions/setup-java@v1
      with: # running setup-java again overwrites the settings.xml
        java-version: 1.8
        server-id: maven # Value of the distributionManagement/repository/id field of the pom.xml
        server-username: MAVEN_USERNAME # env variable for username in deploy
        server-password: MAVEN_CENTRAL_TOKEN # env variable for token in deploy
        gpg-private-key: ${{ secrets.MAVEN_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY }} # Value of the GPG private key to import
        gpg-passphrase: MAVEN_GPG_PASSPHRASE # env variable for GPG private key passphrase

    - name: Publish to Apache Maven Central
      run: mvn deploy
      env:
        MAVEN_USERNAME: maven_username123
        MAVEN_CENTRAL_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.MAVEN_CENTRAL_TOKEN }}
        MAVEN_GPG_PASSPHRASE: ${{ secrets.MAVEN_GPG_PASSPHRASE }}
```

The two `settings.xml` files created from the above example look like the following.

`settings.xml` file created for the first deploy to GitHub Packages
```xml
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>github</id>
      <username>${env.GITHUB_ACTOR}</username>
      <password>${env.GITHUB_TOKEN}</password>
    </server>
    <server>
      <id>gpg.passphrase</id>
      <passphrase>${env.GPG_PASSPHRASE}</passphrase>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
```

`settings.xml` file created for the second deploy to Apache Maven Central
```xml
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>maven</id>
      <username>${env.MAVEN_USERNAME}</username>
      <password>${env.MAVEN_CENTRAL_TOKEN}</password>
    </server>
    <server>
      <id>gpg.passphrase</id>
      <passphrase>${env.MAVEN_GPG_PASSPHRASE}</passphrase>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
```

***NOTE: The `settings.xml` file is created in the Actions $HOME directory. If you have an existing `settings.xml` file at that location, it will be overwritten. See below for using the `settings-path` to change your `settings.xml` file location.***

If `gpg-private-key` input is provided, the private key will be written to a file in the runner's temp directory, the private key file will be imported into the GPG keychain, and then the file will be promptly removed before proceeding with the rest of the setup process. A cleanup step will remove the imported private key from the GPG keychain after the job completes regardless of the job status. This ensures that the private key is no longer accessible on self-hosted runners and cannot "leak" between jobs (hosted runners are always clean instances).

See the help docs on [Publishing a Package](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-packages-with-github-packages/configuring-apache-maven-for-use-with-github-packages#publishing-a-package) for more information on the `pom.xml` file.

Alternatively, you can use `gpg-private-key-path` to point to a key file.

## Publishing using Gradle
```yaml
jobs:

  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up JDK 1.8
      uses: actions/setup-java@v1

    - name: Build with Gradle
      run: gradle build

    - name: Publish to GitHub Packages
      run: gradle publish
      env:
        USERNAME: ${{ github.actor }}
        PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

***NOTE: The `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` need to correspond to the credentials environment variables used in the publishing section of your `build.gradle`.***

See the help docs on [Publishing a Package with Gradle](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-packages-with-github-packages/configuring-gradle-for-use-with-github-packages#example-using-gradle-groovy-for-a-single-package-in-a-repository) for more information on the `build.gradle` configuration file.

## Apache Maven with a settings path

When using an Actions self-hosted runner with multiple shared runners the default `$HOME` directory can be shared by a number runners at the same time which could overwrite existing settings file. Setting the `settings-path` variable allows you to choose a unique location for your settings file.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up JDK 1.8 for Shared Runner
      uses: actions/setup-java@v1
      with:
        java-version: 1.8
        server-id: github # Value of the distributionManagement/repository/id field of the pom.xml
        settings-path: ${{ github.workspace }} # location for the settings.xml file

    - name: Build with Maven
      run: mvn -B package --file pom.xml

    - name: Publish to GitHub Packages Apache Maven
      run: mvn deploy -s $GITHUB_WORKSPACE/settings.xml
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
```
