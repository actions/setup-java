This action sets up a java environment for use in actions by:

- optionally downloading and caching a requested version of java by version and adding to PATH. Default downloads are populated from the [Zulu Community distribution of OpenJDK](http://static.azul.com/zulu/bin/)
- registering problem matchers for error output

# Usage

    java-package: jdk // (jre, jdk, or jdk+fx) - defaults to jdk
    architecture: x64 // (x64 or x86) - defaults to x64
